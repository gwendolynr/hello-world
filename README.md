# hello-world

My name is Gwendolyn Reynolds, but I go by Gwen. This is my first foray into Github. I am quite excited to get started! I am currently living in SLC, Ut. I was working as a research manager in Cambridge, MA. I was hired onto the Data & Innovation team at the Sorenson Impact Center (sorensonimpact.com), and am excited to learn lots of new programming. This is my first step!!
